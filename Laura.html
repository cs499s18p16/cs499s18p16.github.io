  <h1>Week 1 (2/5-2/9)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
  Prior to this week, the group took a visit to Toyota's Georgetown location to tour their facilities, receive an introductory lesson on Scrum, and discuss the story for the first sprint of the project.
  The team also met outside of Toyota's campus to discuss whether to make the project web-based or desktop-based, and what languages we would like to use.  Our first sprint planning meeting was held on 2/6.  We established the goal to implement a login screen for the program.
    
  This week, I provided updates to the project webpage.  Specifically, I authored and edited the Introduction page to our project, and edited the Requirements section of our webpage.
  As a team, we worked together to come up with a team name as requested by our customer, and established a weekly work meeting time.  An initial authentication screen for our program was completed.  
  Monday, February 12th, we will have our second sprint planning meeting with our product owner.  We plan to discuss 
  more specific requirements for the project as far as more in depth user interface elements, platforms, and how to perform specific calculations needed 
  to calculate sprint capacity in scrum teams.  We will then establish the story or group of stories to be completed in our next 1-week sprint.

  <h1>Week 2 (2/12 - 2/16)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
    This week, I assumed the duties of Scrum Master for the team.  I had my first Product Owner/Scrum Master (PO/SM) meeting, where I discussed with the product owner the project backlog and the different methods for analyzing Scrum practices, dealing with interrupts, and breaking up stories unusually high in point value into smaller stories in order to achieve the tight feedback loops most desirable to a Scrum team.  I organized two separate meetings with different subsets of the team to work on this weekâ€™s sprint story, which was to give our website authentication the ability to discern between logins of users with four different roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team member, and Admin).  However, we actually experienced some difficulties in completing this sprint story that required breaking it up into smaller pieces, the first priority piece being to configure our website on a solid hosting environment such as AWS (before doing the backend coding required to create user roles).  

As a developer, I registered a domain name for the project website.  I then created the AWS account the team will use to host and modify the website.   After completing these tasks, I collaborated with Robert to complete the configuration process for hosting the site on AWS.  Lastly, I completed section 2.3 of the CS499 Team 16 webpage.

   <h1>Week 3 (2/19 - 2/23)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
    Team member: This week began with our third sprint planning meeting. During this meeting we collaborated with our PO to overcome the impediment we faced last week (we had issues getting our website that will host our database to run correctly through AWS), as our PO has experience with the AWS environment.  By mid-day Tuesday, we discovered our error and were able to remediate it to get the site running.

In our team work meeting Tuesday evening, we discussed the procedure (essentially some rough pseudocode), and the database schema we would need to follow to complete the "user roles" sprint story.  I then collaborated with Emma to create preliminary designs of the user screens for our project, which we will include in our midterm presentation.

Developer: I added some html to our authentication page to allow for users to choose which role they want to log in under, pushed the changes to github, and reuploaded the html to our AWS account.  

Scrum Master:  I worked with my team and their availabilities to schedule an appointment with Presentation U to review our midterm presentation, and began designing a schedule for preparing and practicing our project presentation.
