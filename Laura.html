  <h1>Week 1 (2/5-2/9)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">This week, I provided updates to the project webpage.  Specifically, I authored and edited the Introduction page to our project, and edited the Requirements section of our webpage.
  As a team, we worked together to come up with a team name as requested by our customer.  We also discussed how to make an initial design for the user interface of our project's 
  login mechanism.  Monday, February 12th, we will have our second sprint planning meeting with our product owner.  We plan to discuss 
  more specific requirements for the project as far as more in depth user interface elements, platforms, and how to perform specific calculations needed 
  to calculate sprint capacity in scrum teams.  We will then establish our next story or group of stories to be completed in our next 1 week sprint.
