  <h1>Week 1 (2/5-2/11)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
  Prior to this week, the group took a visit to Toyota's Georgetown location to tour their facilities, receive an introductory lesson on Scrum, and discuss the story for the first sprint of the project.
  The team also met outside of Toyota's campus to discuss whether to make the project web-based or desktop-based, and what languages we would like to use.  Our first sprint planning meeting was held on 2/6.  We established the goal to implement a login screen for the program.
    
  This week, I provided updates to the project webpage.  Specifically, I authored and edited the Introduction page to our project, and edited the Requirements section of our webpage.
  As a team, we worked together to come up with a team name as requested by our customer, and established a weekly work meeting time.  An initial authentication screen for our program was completed.  
  Monday, February 12th, we will have our second sprint planning meeting with our product owner.  We plan to discuss 
  more specific requirements for the project as far as more in depth user interface elements, platforms, and how to perform specific calculations needed 
  to calculate sprint capacity in scrum teams.  We will then establish the story or group of stories to be completed in our next 1-week sprint.

  <h1>Week 2 (2/12 - 2/18)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
    This week, I assumed the duties of Scrum Master for the team.  I had my first Product Owner/Scrum Master (PO/SM) meeting, where I discussed with the product owner the project backlog and the different methods for analyzing Scrum practices, dealing with interrupts, and breaking up stories unusually high in point value into smaller stories in order to achieve the tight feedback loops most desirable to a Scrum team.  I organized two separate meetings with different subsets of the team to work on this week’s sprint story, which was to give our website authentication the ability to discern between logins of users with four different roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team member, and Admin).  However, we actually experienced some difficulties in completing this sprint story that required breaking it up into smaller pieces, the first priority piece being to configure our website on a solid hosting environment such as AWS (before doing the backend coding required to create user roles).  

As a developer, I registered a domain name for the project website.  I then created the AWS account the team will use to host and modify the website.   After completing these tasks, I collaborated with Robert to complete the configuration process for hosting the site on AWS.  Lastly, I completed section 2.3 of the CS499 Team 16 webpage.

   <h1>Week 3 (2/19 - 2/25)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
    Team member: This week began with our third sprint planning meeting. During this meeting we collaborated with our PO to overcome the impediment we faced last week (we had issues getting our website that will host our database to run correctly through AWS), as our PO has experience with the AWS environment.  By mid-day Tuesday, we discovered our error and were able to remediate it to get the site running.

In our team work meeting Tuesday evening, we discussed the procedure (essentially some rough pseudocode), and the database schema we would need to follow to complete the "user roles" sprint story.  I then collaborated with Emma to create preliminary designs of the user screens for our project, which we will include in our midterm presentation.

<br><br>Developer: I added some html to our authentication page to allow for users to choose which role they want to log in under, pushed the changes to github, and reuploaded the html to our AWS account.  

<br><br>Scrum Master:  I worked with my team and their availabilities to schedule an appointment with Presentation U to review our midterm presentation, and began designing a schedule for preparing and practicing our project presentation.  

  </p>
  
   <h1>Week 4 (2/26 - 3/4)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
    The team encountered an impediment at the very end of Week 3 with our website configuration that prevented usage of Amazon RDS.  However, despite absence of Amazon RDS, we were able to write the code needed to complete the sprint story that tasked us to add ability for our tool to distinguish user roles by employing database programming locally. However, in response to the impediment we faced, we added fixing our Amazon RDS problem to our To Do list as its own story.      
<br> <br>
Due to midterm and spring break conflicts, this sprint was extended until May 19th to give the team time to solve the issues of the previous week, and also to focus on our midterm presentation.  However, as Scrum Master, I still met with our PO to create these future sprint stories: 1) As a user I want a landing page for my Team so that I can communicate availability across the team, and 2) As user I want the ability to create teams in the tool so that I can get data on one group of users.  Story 1 was put on the To Do for the next sprint, while story 2 was put onto the sprint backlog for future sprints.  
<br> <br>
For our midterm presentation,  I compiled a list of deliverables that were needed for the project website, and drew parallels between those deliverables and the visuals we would be using for our presentation.  These deliverables included: synopses for the overview and environment of the scrum tool application, an overall module diagram of the tool, an ER diagram of the database backend, user screens (our login page, landing page, default page for when a user has no distinctive team information, and potential data representations), and text based descriptions of user scenarios.  Talking amongst all our team members, we were able to divide the work up equally.
<br> <br>
I volunteered to create our ER diagram, as I am currently in a database programming course and have fresh knowledge of the concepts required.  I am also creating a list of user scenarios with descriptions.

  <h1>Week 5 (3/5 - 3/18)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
    This week, the group met to put together our presentation and practice it, both with each other and with the aid of Presentation U!.  On Wednesday we presented formally, with the following structure: I presented an introduction to our project, which included a brief overview of Scrum and the customer’s need for our project.  Emma presented the user screens and scenarios we are working on for our project.  Poe presented the backend information about our project’s infrastructure and overall data flow.  Lastly, Robert gave a status report and a goal summary for our project.  

<br><br>

Unfortunately, presenting on Wednesday along with midterm exams limited our progress through the rest of the week leading to Spring Break, and most of our group travelled and had limited capacity for work during the break.  However, I was still able to meet with our customer on Tuesday, March 13th, and discuss the goals for the next sprint that will hopefully restart the team’s momentum when classes resume and team members return to town.  First, we plan to meet as a team and find a resolution to our infrastructure issues, which will potentially involve migrating our code from AWS to the CS Department Multilab machines (something already discussed and approved with our customer if we wish to do so).  Upon finalizing our infrastructure plans, our first story will be to successfully implement and retest the new infrastructure.  Second, we will resume construction of the four landing pages of the web application that correspond to the user roles: Admin, Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Team Member.  Once we achieve successful navigation to the landing pages, we will begin adding functionality to each page that is unique to the user role it corresponds to.

  <h1>Week 6 (3/19-3/25)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
    This week the team finalized the decision to migrate our infrastructure to the CS department multilab machines.  Poe and Robert worked on moving the codebase and adding to the php for the login of the Scrum tool.  Emma and I split up the landing pages.  I made preliminary landing pages for the role of Admin and Team Member, so that when we test our login tool under different user roles, we will be able to discern whether our tool is navigating them to the correct page and they are only seeing what they are allowed to see as any specific scrum role.  The admin page will involve inserting, updating, and deleting entries in the database.  These operations will allow adding team members to the tool, and placing them in teams.  This will likely be the activity of our next sprint.  The team member page will allow the user to access their account info and input their hours off, which will likely also be part of a future sprint.  
  </p>
  
  <h1>Week 7 (3/26-4/1)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
This week as a developer, I worked with Emma to finish styling the landing pages.  Then, I implemented logout buttons for every type of user.  Robert and I discussed pseudocode and unit testing for the ability to add users to the tool, and later inserting them into teams.  

As Scrum Master, I resumed my weekly SM/PO meeting with the customer.  We reviewed the product backlog and added  story for implementing the ability of the PO in the tool to add projects, and add a team to a project.  We also reviewed  the sprint backlog and reorganized our stories for the up and coming sprints.  

Lastly, I wrote the document for unit testing, which is part of our overall test plan.  

  </p>
  
  <h1>Week 9 (4/2-4/8)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue">
    This week as a Scrum Master, I talked with our PO about what stories we wanted to try and complete by the end of the project.  We created new stories to implement an interactive calendar for the tool.
    As developer, I did some PHP programming with HTML and mySQL to provide functionality for adding users in our tool to a team.  As of the end of 4/8, this functionality is working for some test cases: the tool can add users to a team by clicking on a team name, which takes them to another page for adding users.  However, the dynamically generated team HTML table on the admin landing page is still in progress. Once we get this functioning, we will be able to display a list of current teams  on the admin page.  Our goal is to make each team name able to be clicked on by the admin to add or remove members from the team, as well as remove the team entirely.  Then, we hope to implement an interactive calendar for team landing pages that will show the % availability of a team based on hours that the user inputs.
