  <h1>Week 1 (2/5-2/9)</h1>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
  Prior to this week, the group took a visit to Toyota's Georgetown location to tour their facilities, receive an introductory lesson on Scrum, and discuss the story for the first sprint of the project.
  The team also met outside of Toyota's campus to discuss whether to make the project web-based or desktop-based, and what languages we would like to use.  Our first sprint planning meeting was held on 2/6.  We established the goal to implement a login screen for the program.
    
  This week, I provided updates to the project webpage.  Specifically, I authored and edited the Introduction page to our project, and edited the Requirements section of our webpage.
  As a team, we worked together to come up with a team name as requested by our customer, and established a weekly work meeting time.  An initial authentication screen for our program was completed.  
  Monday, February 12th, we will have our second sprint planning meeting with our product owner.  We plan to discuss 
  more specific requirements for the project as far as more in depth user interface elements, platforms, and how to perform specific calculations needed 
  to calculate sprint capacity in scrum teams.  We will then establish the story or group of stories to be completed in our next 1-week sprint.
