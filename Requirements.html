<p>
  Features (in priority order)
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><b>Database</b></li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disk">
        <li>Use MySQL database, which is an open source search-query language database management system, to store the login information of each employee on the Scrum team, as well as each week's availability statistics (unavailable hours per person, working hours in a day/week, sprint cadence a.k.a. sprint length)</li>
        <li>Essential: store and be able to manipulate team member availability in decimal format by number of hours, compute team availability percentage from individual team member availabilities. Stretch goal: extend availability functionality to by dynamic as far forward as 3 sprints.  Also, compute capacity per sprint for any team. </li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Web Application</b></li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disk">
        <li>The tool will be hosted on a LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) compatible server.</li>
        <li>This site will house all the databases and will be accessible by all qualified employees using a secure login to the web appilication that is unique to each of them</li>
        <li>GUI for Windows and Mac OS</li>
        <li>HTTPS will be used for secure login</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>User Interface</b></li>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disk">
         <li>Simplistic look and feel, using color scheme compatible for all viewers (no color combinations that conflict with color-blind vision)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Effort and Size Estimation</h2>
    <p>
      The effort required to successfully complete this project by the end of the 
      semester will be estimated by assigning story points to different tasks/milestones. This method
      of estimating labor is modeled after the fibonnaci sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      A rule of thumb when scheduling is to allocate 1/3 of the time for planning but since we are past that
      point, this estimation will not take that into consideration. The story points start off with the
      implementation of the project including the setup.

      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li><b>Webpage Host [AWS] = 18 SP</b></li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:disk">
            <li>Get every team member set up -- 3 SP</li>
            <li>Host and launch site -- 13 SP</li>
            <li>Transfer code from Github to AWS -- 2 SP</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li><b>Database = 68 SP</b></li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:disk">
            <li>Store user login/sign up information -- 5 SP </li>
            <li>Authentication -- 8 SP</li>
            <li>Teams table (for scrum master only) -- 8 SP</li>
            <li>User's availability -- 13 SP</li>
            <li>Capacity calculation and foreshadowing -- 34 SP</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li><b>UI/UX with HTML/CSS = 32 SP</b></li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:disk">
            <li>Login/Sign up page --  3 SP </li>
            <li>[Personalized] Home page -- 3 SP</li>
            <li>A Visual of team members' availability (graph, table, chart, etc) -- 13 SP</li>
            <li>Visual of team's capacity -- 13 SP</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li><b>Testing & Documentation = 21 SP</b></li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li><b>Overhead (holidays, sick/snow days, presentation, etc) = 34.75 SP</b></li>
          <p>This was calculated by taking 25% of the total estimated story points for the 
            project (including testing and Documentation). That is, 25% of 139 SP which 
            is 34.75 story points. This results to a total of 173.75 story points.
          </p>
      </ul>

      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li><b>Contigency (nothing ever goes right) = 43.44 SP</b></li>
        <p>This was calculated by taking 25% of the total SP (173.75) {.25 * 173.75 = 43.44}. The 
          total now becomes 217.19
        </p>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <p>Rounding the above number to the next whole number results to a total of 
      <b>217 story points</b>; an estimation of the effort required to create the Toyota Scrum Tool.
