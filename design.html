  <p>
    Toyota has been undergoing a Scrum "transformation" as of recent and with that, Scrum tools have become a necessity. The scrum tool our team will be focused on is a web application that will be designed to be a tool to allow for tracking and estimating of team availability with reporting for planned and actual results. At an overview, either an admin/Scrum Master/Product Owner/Team Member will be able to log in into the web app and view current projects and planning based on who they are. The scrum tool will allow for team members to input their availability for a week to work on a project that way team leaders can see who they have available. At the end of the week, the actual production of the team, which is measured in points, will also be input. The tool will estimated the team's expected production for a week based on availability and when the actual point value for the week is input, the scrum tool will compare the results and keep track of production as each week goes along, and adjust its estimations based on results.
