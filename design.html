  <p>
    Toyota has been undergoing a Scrum "transformation" as of recent and with that, Scrum tools have become a necessity. The scrum tool our team will be focused on is a web application that will be designed to allow for tracking and estimating of team availability with reporting for planned and actual capacity results. At an overview, either an admin/Scrum Master/Product Owner/Team Member will be able to log in into the web app and view current projects and planning based on their user credentials. The scrum tool will allow for team members to input their availability for a week to work on a project, that way team leaders can see who they have available and when. At the end of the week, the actual productivity of the team, which is measured in points, will also be input. The tool will then estimate the team's capacity for the following week based on factors such as story points.  When the actual point value of capacity for the week is input, the scrum tool will compare the results to the week previous, using this data to keep track of production as each week goes along, and adjust its estimations based on results.
