  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
     Recently, Toyota has been undergoing a Scrum "transformation".  Due to the Scrum model being such a recent addition to the company, tools to aid its processes have become a necessity. The scrum tool our team will be focused on is a web application that will be designed to allow for tracking and estimating of team availability, with handling for planned and actual availability across sprints. Possible users include the tool Admin, Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Team Member.  Each of these roles will be able to login to the web app and view their current project and its team availability data, but within the permissions constraints of their user roles. The scrum tool will allow for team members to input their availability in the number of hours they cannot work during a given sprint (the tool conventionally assumes a 1-week sprint).  This information will be displayed via an interactive team calendar, which the Scrum Master and Product Owner of a team can view to track the availability of their team for each day in a sprint.  This information will aid both scrum roles in story planning and effort estimation, because they will know how able each team member is to do work based on how many working hours they plan and actually execute.
