  <h1><b>Introduction: Toyota Scrum Tools Project</b></h1>
  <p>
  Toyota Scrum Tools is a web application created to increase the efficiency of capacity computations in Toyota Scrum teams. A Scrum Master needs to gather data on the availability of individual team members in order to calculate capacity at the beginning and end of each sprint. A sprint is defined as the numerical value that a project/a week's amount of tasks will require to be completed. This numerical value is based on a point system rather than time itself since predicitng how long something will take to complete accurately is virtually impossible. This system will allow Scrum Masters to see each Scrum Team's productivity for the week, as well as see the expected value for the following week based on the predictive algorithm that will be implemented. The calculations for these sprints will take into count the absence(s) of team members and adjust accordingly as well. Essentially, this system aims to allow the gathering and manipulation of relevant team data in a dynamic environment that is easy to navigate and interpret.
