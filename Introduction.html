  <h1><b>Introduction: Toyota Scrum Tools Project</b></h1>
  <p>
 The Toyota Scrum Tool is a web application created to increase the efficiency of availability tracking in Toyota Scrum teams.  Current methods for tracking availability within the company consist of complex spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel maintained solely by the Scrum Master.  This project aims to simplify the data collection, analysis, and maintenance required for the contents of these spreadsheets via a web application.  This application is paired with an intuitive database backend, and is represented by an uncomplicated user interface with desirable look and feel.

The Scrum roles of Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developer will all be used to define different account types for the tool that possess distinct funcitonalities.  In general, a Scrum Master needs to gather data on the availability of individual team members in order to help estimate the amount of work that can be done in any particular sprint (a sprint in a Scrum team is defined as a 1-4 week period in which tasks toward a project are completed).    The Toyota Scrum Tool is designed to use the number of working hours in a day, the number of developers on the team, and the amount of hours marked unavailable per day by each individual team member to calculate a percentage of team availability for each day.  Scrum Masters and Product Owners will be able to view this information in a simple interactive calendar that is easy to navigate.  Team members will be able to enter their unavailable hours in decimal format (i.e. 0.5 hours = half an hour), potentially up to three sprints out from the current sprint.  The stretch goal of the project is to also allow for Scrum Masters to edit availabilities of team members if needed, and eventually allow for the tool to also calculate team capacity per sprint.
