  Toyota Scrum Tools is an app created to increase the efficiency of capacity computations in Toyota Scrum teams. A Scrum Master needs to gather data on the availability of individual team members in order to calculate capacity at the beginning and end of each sprint.  This system aims to allow the gathering and manipulation of relevant team data in a dynamic environment that is easy to navigate and interpret.
