  <h1><b>Introduction: Toyota Scrum Tools Project</b></h1>
  <p>
  Toyota Scrum Tools is a web application created to increase the efficiency of availability
  computations in Toyota Scrum teams. A Scrum Master needs to gather data on the availability
  of individual team members in order to help estimate the amount of work that can be done in any particular
 sprint. A sprint in a Scrum team is defined as a 1-4 week period in which tasks toward a project are completed.
 This system will allow Scrum Masters to see each Scrum Team's productivity for
  the week, as well as see the expected value for the following week based on the predictive
  algorithm that will be implemented. The calculations for these sprints will take into count 
  the absence(s) of team members and adjust accordingly as well. Essentially, this system aims
  to allow the gathering and manipulation of relevant team data in a dynamic environment that
  is easy to navigate and interpret.
