  <h1>Week 1 Updates (February 5 - 9, 2018)</h1>
  <p>
    Prior to this week, the group met with each other to discuss scheduing issues and set a time to meet up for at least 2 hours every week. We also established a set time to meet with the customer every week after meeting twice already. In our team  meetings thus far, we have decided how we will complete this project (what language/tools will be used) and how we will divide the work up weekly, as well as agreed upon a team name rather than just Team 16.
    As for my personal work done, this week I created the website that is needed in this class to track the team members' weekly activity, complete our GCCR requirement, and to turn in as the final report along with the project we will be working on throughout the semester.
