  <h1>Week 1 Updates (February 5 - 9, 2018)</h1>
  <p>
    Prior to this week, the group met with each other to discuss scheduing issues and set a time to meet up for at least 2 hours every week. We also established a set time to meet with the customer every week after meeting twice already. In our team  meetings thus far, we have decided how we will complete this project (what language/tools will be used) and how we will divide the work up weekly, as well as agreed upon a team name rather than just Team 16.
    As for my personal work done, this week I created the website that is needed in this class to track the team members' weekly activity, complete our GCCR requirement, and to turn in as the final report along with the project we will be working on throughout the semester.

  <h2>Week 2 Updates (February 12 - 16, 2018)</h2>
  <p>
    For this week, we met again with our customer and discussed what the sprint for this week would look like. The main goal for this week was to continue setting up the login screen by: 1. Hosting the site off of a real platform such as AWS so that the web application would be accessible from any browser, and
    2. Designating specific roles for logins based on the scrum team member, i.e. Team Member, Scrum Master, Admin, and Product Owner. I assisted mostly in getting the website launched through AWS and setting up the page to look as it did when hosted through Github, but I also began looking into setting up the database we will need to store all the information
    for this application in MySQL. Due to time constraints and other conflicts between everyone in the group, this sprint was split up, so this will all be continued to be worked on in the following week as well.
