  <h2>Week 1 Updates (February 5 - 9, 2018)</h2>
  <p>
    Prior to this week, the group met with each other to discuss scheduing issues and set a time to meet up for at least 2 hours every week. We also established a set time to meet with the customer every week after meeting twice already. In our team  meetings thus far, we have decided how we will complete this project (what language/tools will be used) and how we will divide the work up weekly, as well as agreed upon a team name rather than just Team 16.
    As for my personal work done, this week I created the website that is needed in this class to track the team members' weekly activity, complete our GCCR requirement, and to turn in as the final report along with the project we will be working on throughout the semester.

  <h2>Week 2 Updates (February 12 - 16, 2018)</h2>
  <p>
    For this week, we met again with our customer and discussed what the sprint for this week would look like. The main goal for this week was to continue setting up the login screen by: 1. Hosting the site off of a real platform such as AWS so that the web application would be accessible from any browser, and
    2. Designating specific roles for logins based on the scrum team member, i.e. Team Member, Scrum Master, Admin, and Product Owner. I assisted mostly in getting the website launched through AWS and setting up the page to look as it did when hosted through Github, but I also began looking into setting up the database we will need to store all the information
    for this application in MySQL. Due to time constraints and other conflicts between everyone in the group, this sprint was split up, so this will all be continued to be worked on in the following week as well.

  </p>
</br>
  <h2> Week 3 Updates (February 20 - 24, 2018)</h2>
  <p>
    This week, we collectively continued to work towards our sprint from last week in regards to establishing a login for 4 roles related to the scrum tool. As for my personal work this week, I created a mock database using phpmyadmin hosted locally to connect to the login page and get it functioning properly. Unfortunately obstacles arose as this method was attempted to be transferred over to the actual web application as I discovered that the static web hosting from AWS S3 will only interpret HTML and CSS code, therefore I attempted to build the web application through the Elastic Beanstalk service, but could not configure it properly to have it running as it should. Aside from coding, I met with the other members of my group to discuss implementation methids, as well as the plan for the presentation that we will be giving the week of March 7th.

  <h2> Week 4 Updates (Febraury 26 - March 2, 2018) </h2>
  <p>
    This week we againspoke with our customer and decided to plan out a 2 week sprint due to midterm examinations and other school-related conflicts affecting full effort being put into the project. As for what I've done personally this week, I've continued setting up the databse needed for the web application to store the information of all users and project information, as well as continued to try and set up the web application through Amazon's beanstalk service. On top of that, I have begun working on a "landing page" that will appear when an authorized user logs in with correct credentials. Aside from the project I have also begun preparing for the midterm presentation that will be given on the Wednesday of March 7th, 2018 about our product and the progress we have made thus far.
</br>
</br>
<h2> Week 5 Updates (March 5 - 9, 2018)</h2>
    This week was spent preparing for the midterm presentation that was to be given during class on Wednesday, March 7th. After finalizing everything needed with the web application, such as the demo landing pages, our group then attended a Presentation U to discuss how to go about our presentation. After the splitting up the talking points and rehearsing together, the presentation was given and everything, for the most part, went smoothly.
</br>
</br>
<h2> Week 6 Updates (March 12 - 16, 2018) </h2>
    This week, I unfortunately not able to accomplish much for the project as my time was spent outside of the country without any computer access. Our group will be continuing the sprint discussed with our customer from the previous Skype meeting and will collectively move towards establishing a completely working, yet basic, application.
</br>
</br>
<h2> Week 7 Updates (March 19 - 23, 2018)</h2>
    This week I was able to copy over all the files related to this project into my personal multilab as the group transitions away from using the Amazon web services. With that, I also refined the login page used for the web application as some issues arose due to the version of PHP used and connecting to MySQL. The end result is a login page that will redirect to the landing page designed by other group member(s) based on the role of the user that is attempting to log in. If the credentials of the user are not matched within the database, it will be caught and stay on the login page until correct information is input.

  </br>
  </br>
  <h2> Week 8 Updates (March 26 - 30, 2018)</h2>
      For this week, I was able to complete the login system with user verification for the web application, which was connected to a MySQL database created on the multilab server. Within the login system, each user that logs in has an assigned role in relation to the Scrum team, and based on that role, once logged in the application would direct the user to its designated landing page. The functionalities for each role will then be implemented within these pages since some roles have more abilities compared to others. Along with that, I was also able to give the admin role access to add new users to the system, which is vital for what the final product version of this scrum tool will be as new employees will constantly need to be added to this. Their credentials are added into the database and until they are assigned to a scrum team, they are sent to a default page with access to virtually nothing once they have logged in. The next step is to give Scrum Master(s) and the admin the abillity to add users to a certain team, thus changing the landing page in which they are redirected to, and updating some information within the database.

    </br>
    <h2> Week 9 Updates (April 2 - 6, 2018)</h2>
    For this week, my main focus was enhancing security throughout our site. Previously anyone could access whichever site they chose to by simply typing in the direct url, giving them access to all of the site's information including access to the database. In order to resolve this, verification code was placed into every page to ensure the session had been started through logging in with verified credentials. If not, the user would be automatically redirected to the login page every time. On top of that, I also worked on the functionality of the site in terms of redirecting users, including new users added to the database, and rights of the admin.
