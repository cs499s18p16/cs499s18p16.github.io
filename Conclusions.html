  <h1>Conclusions</h1>

    This project has allowed us, as seniors going into the workforce, to develop several different skills in both team building and computer science.  As developers, working on the Toyota Scrum tool allowed us to learn about:
    
    </br></br>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>How to connect a database to a server, and perform queries into the database using mySQL and PHP.</li>
      <li>How to develop security measures to control flow through web pages that are required to have permission restrictions.</li>
      <li>How to deploy a web application onto a Windows server.  To test our product on a server accessible to the customer, the team was able to learn how to deploy our code to a Windows server using IIS.</li>
      <li>How to collaborate on a group coding project using GitHub, and how to prevent and remediate merge conflicts.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As members emulating Scrum Team roles, we also acquired several beneficial experiences related to teamwork and interacting with people within the industry.  Just a small subset of these experiences includes:

    </br></br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Scheduling group meetings and individual meetings, and getting around scheduling conflicts.</li>
      <li>Maintaining communication with all team members between checkpoints, and meeting deadlines.</li>
      <li>Overcoming interrupts during sprints (ex. Change in infrastructure, university holidays, etc), and implementing constructive dialogue during sprint retrospectives about how the project can be improved.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    Luckily, changes in customer requirements were minimal.  Our project started on a solid foundation of basic requirements: that our application be deployable on the web and accessible through all browsers, with a simplistic yet appealing user interface.  The project originally began as an application which could help teams to collaboratively track team capacity.  However, the team experienced delays in developing our infrastructure, due to opting not to use the original code base for the product and start from scratch, and migrating our code from AWS to a LAMP infrastructure.  As a result, we decided along with our customer to modify the Toyota Scrum Tool to be first and foremost an engine to handle team member availability, where members will inputs hours they are unavailable in decimal format, and this data will be processed for Scrum Masters and Product Owners to view in an interactive calendar format. Capacity tracking is a future enhancement to be handled by future teams.

    If our team were starting over, one thing we might have done differently would be to start the project by using the code base of the previous semesterâ€™s Scrum Tool team.  At the acquisition of this code base at the beginning of the semester, the group elected to start from scratch, as developing from an old code base can be limiting and documentation styles can be difficult to decipher.  In addition, our group believed we would learn more from the project and be able to develop exactly what we wanted if we started from scratch.  However, retrospectively, with the experience in PHP and mySQL programming we have now, using the old code base might have been more feasible a feat than we originally thought, and potentially could have allowed more time to develop the functionality of the project rather than the main infrastructure.
