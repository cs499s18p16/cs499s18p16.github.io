	  Being the first update, there are some weeks prior to this that will be covered in this week's update. To begin, the team has met three times to discuss scheduling issues, and meet with the customer. We have determined that this project will be completed while using Scrum methods. As a result, we will have weekly meetings one with the customer to receive weekly goals and one with just the team to discuss how these goals will be achieved, and divide work as needed. The weekly meetings with just the developers of the team will, also, be used for completing work on the current tasks.

	  For my own personal work this week, I have completed updates to the project webpage, and helped to set up a group repository to host the project webpage and store the group's production code for the project.
