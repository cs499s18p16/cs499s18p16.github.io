	  Being the first update, there are some weeks prior to this that will be covered in this week's update. To begin, the team has met three times to discuss scheduling issues, and meet with the customer. We have determined that this project will be completed while using Scrum methods. As a result, we will have weekly meetings one with the customer to receive weekly goals and one with just the team to discuss how these goals will be achieved, and divide work as needed. The weekly meetings with just the developers of the team will, also, be used for completing work on the current tasks.

	  For my own personal work this week, I have completed updates to the project webpage, and helped to set up a group repository to host the project webpage and store the group's production code for the project.

	  This week was spent attempting to set up a host for the web application. After some consideration, the team decided to use Amazon Web Services for hosting, and as a provider for the database. The majority of the work for this week was research, as most of the team wasn't familiar with the environment provided by AWS. My contributions involved setting up IAM user access to the AWS Root account for the rest of the team, and troubleshooting some of the issues encountered with the static hosting service. Ultimately, we did not get as far as we would have liked, but we were able to establish the hosting service without much experience in its use.
