    <div class= "content-container">

	  Being the first update, there are some weeks prior to this that will be covered in this week's update. To begin, the team has met three times to discuss scheduling issues, and meet with the customer. We have determined that this project will be completed while using Scrum methods. As a result, we will have weekly meetings one with the customer to receive weekly goals and one with just the team to discuss how these goals will be achieved, and divide work as needed. The weekly meetings with just the developers of the team will, also, be used for completing work on the current tasks.

	  For my own personal work this week, I have completed updates to the project webpage, and helped to set up a group repository to host the project webpage and store the group's production code for the project.

	  This week was spent attempting to set up a host for the web application. After some consideration, the team decided to use Amazon Web Services for hosting, and as a provider for the database. The majority of the work for this week was research, as most of the team wasn't familiar with the environment provided by AWS. My contributions involved setting up IAM user access to the AWS Root account for the rest of the team, and troubleshooting some of the issues encountered with the static hosting service. Ultimately, we did not get as far as we would have liked, but we were able to establish the hosting service without much experience in its use.

      <div class="content">
	<p>
	  This week, we managed to correct the issues with the web hosting. Withi that completed, we moved forward with the original task of completing a login page. For my part of this assignment, I did research into various methods that were expected to work for this task. My particular focus was on the AWS Cognito service. Using that service, we are able to develop a userbase that is managed by the AWS system, and use that to give access to the web application. I will need to look further into this system, however, as we are unsure of how to interact with this service from a static website. We may need to develop more of the backend servicesbefore we can reasonably use this system.

	  This week was primarilty focused on completing some of the design decisions, as well as, speculating on those possibly made in the future. With this project being built as a progressive work, we have not made specifications for certain parts that will eventually be in the final product. In spite of that, I was able to develop a diagram to illustrate the flow of data within the program, and how different modules interacted. In addition, more research was completed to define what services we are using with AWS. I have increasing concern over the use of AWS as a service, but am confident that we will be able to figure it out in time for the final delivery. Additionally, we have moved past the potential of using AWS Cognito service for the userbase, because it is insufficient for the type of information being kept about the users. A database implemented through the AWS Relational Database Service will need to be configured to complete this task.

	  The majority of the past two weeks was dedicated to the migration of our back-end infrastructure. I have been working on setting up the new databse schema, and adjusting some of our files to cope with differences in our original coding environments. As an example of this, some functions previously used in our code were found to be deprecated( and phased out) when migrated to the multilab servers, which use a newer version of PHP. In addition, some of my work was focused on the midterm presentation, where I developed some of our graphics and demonstrated the way our back-end infrastructure is (and was) set up.
