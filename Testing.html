<h3>2. Integration/Function Testing</h3>




</br>
<h3>3. System Testing</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  Function Testing
  <br />
  As the system is being developed, new functional requirements are also being added. When a new function is "complete", one of the developers is expected to go through the full function as a "user" to decide if the function has met all specfic requirements. A test is done for each possible scenario. For example, if a certain function is expected to work on Firefox and Google Chrome, then the scenario would be played out on both browsers following the same path. The test is passed, if the "user" is able to complete the task without leaving the constraints of the test.
  <br />
  Performance Testing
  <br />
  In this form of testing, the overall system is checked by running through all of the functions in sequence. If there is any form of delay in response by the web application, the underlying systems are checked further for possible problems arising from the basic software running these systems, or for any changes that may have caused the systems to slow down.
  <br />
  Acceptance Testing
  <br />
  Due to the nature of this system, acceptance testing is performed in the same way as Function testing, but the overall system is browsed through in a pattern that would resemble a single user. This "single user" test is repeated multiple times across all of the different browsers that the web application is designed for. In each of the "single user" scenarios, all of the tests are performed by the customer using "single user" scenarios of their choosing. This testing is done with little input from the developing team, however the testing is limited to pre-established requirements for the sake of continuity and consistency.
  <br />
  Installation Testing
  <br />
  In this form of testing, the web application is run through the full installation process. This is to include the set up of the mysql server, and the apache server used to host the web application, as well as creating the database within the mysql server from the provided sql file. The rest of the web application is run directly from the server and need only be installed by copying the files to the appropriate directories with the correct permissions. To complete this testing, one of the developers will remove all of the files and databases from their own environment, and re-install the web application to their system by following a set of instructions. A successful test will produce a new working system unique from established versions, but identical in make up.

<h3>4. Customer Testing</h3>
Each week the customer is made aware of what has been implemented thus far and the rate of progress for the team on the development of the product. At any point in time the customer may ask to see the code, but as of now only visual deliverables have been shared. The application right now is connected to our multilab servers, which the customer will not have access to once this semester has concluded, so once we have a fully functioning product, the code will be sent over to the customer so that they may adjust it accordingly to work with their servers. In these coming weeks we will continue to meet with the customer and showcase what we currently have working now, and the customer will give us feedback as they see fit. Customer testing should be available soon.
