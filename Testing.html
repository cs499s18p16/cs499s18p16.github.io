<h3>4. Customer Testing</h3>
Each week the customer is made aware of what has been implemented thus far and the rate of progress for the team on the development of the product. At any point in time the customer may ask to see the code, but as of now only visual deliverables have been shared. The application right now is connected to our multilab servers, which the customer will not have access to once this semester has concluded, so once we have a fully functioning product, the code will be sent over to the customer so that they may adjust it accordingly to work with their servers. In these coming weeks we will continue to meet with the customer and showcase what we currently have working now, and the customer will give us feedback as they see fit. Customer testing should be available soon.
