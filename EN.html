        <h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
        
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Week 1: 2/5/18 - 2/9/18</h2>
            <p>
                Before we even began planning or implementing our project, we visited Toyota in Georgetown in-order to meet our
                customer. During this meeting, the customer went in depth on what is expected of us this semester. After that, we met
                as a team so as to jot down ideas on how we were going to create the scrum tool. We then had our first sprint planning with the
                customer on February 6th, which resulted to us getting our first story/milestone.
                My participation this week was in the implementation of the first milestone; I created a login form, which is what
                the customer had requested for the first sprint.
            </p>

            <h2>Week 2: 2/12/18 - 2/16/18</h2>
            <p>
                As per usual, we (virtually) met with our customer/product owner on Monday for a sprint planning. After this meeting, we had our work 
                cut out for us for the week, which was to allow different kinds of users (team members) to be able to login into the system
                we are implementing. Additionally, the product owner asked the team to find an alternative for hosting the web-based tool for calculating capacity. 
                The latter proved to be a much more difficult task than we anticipated therefore this week's sprint was focused on finding the best solution. My contribution this 
                week was in researching the best host for our web tool. In the end, we settled on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I also contributed in 
                updating our team's webpage; I did section 2.2
            </p>

            <h2>Week 3: 2/19/18 - 2/23/18</h2>
            <p>
                We started off the week by having our weekly sprint meeting with our customer on Monday. In this meeting, Victor (our customer)
                helped us launch/host our website such that all team members could access it - some of us were having trouble accessing the correct website content 
                (the link would lead to a different website if not typed in exactly as 'http://www.toyotascrumtools.com'). After this meeting, we met as a team to go over our
                game plan for the stories given by the customer, which because of the roadblocks we recently hit, was the same as last week's. We also started working
                on the upcoming project presentation for CS 499.
            </p><p>
                Laura and I worked together to come up with the content of our presentation. A part of our presentation will be screens of the different functionalities 
                of the tool we're implementing (Toyota Scrum Tool). Together we came up with a rough draft of the tool's design and some of the functionality for later phases. 
                On my own, I worked on creating on some of the screens needed for the presentation. Most of the project is yet to be implemented so for the later 
                (and more complicated) sections/functionality of this tool, I had to actually design using graphics editing tools.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Week 4: 2/26/28 - 3/2/18</h2>
            <p>
                A huge team accomplishment this week was getting beyond the obstacles we encountered last week. From this achievement,
                we were able to complete the sprint the customer gave us of making sure that our tool allows different kinds of users 
                (i.e scrum master, product owner, etc) to login. In the weekly sprint meeting, the customer gave us new stories to work on
                this week and next week as well (because of midterm conflicts we can't finish the sprint in 1 week). From there, 
                we (the team) met the following day to discuss the weekly game plan as per usual.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have a team presentation coming up so we focused solely on that. We divided the work based on the requirements of the
                design assignment we are to submit tomorrow. I am designing the screens for the landing and default page, which we'll use in the  
                presentation to show our classmates the progress of our tool and what we plan on implementing in the coming weeks.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Week 5: 3/5/18 - 3/18/18</h2>
            <p>
                Because this was midterm exams week (and we had multiple exams to study for), not much of the project was accomplished.
                However, in the midst of studying hard for midterms, we were able to prepare and present a brief overview of our project
                to the class. This is how I contributed to the team this week: by creating user screens to demonstrate how the Toyota Scrum Tool
                will look like. Additionally, during the presentation I took up to 5 minutes to talk about different user scenarios.
            </p>

            <h2>Week 6: 3/19/18 - 3/23/18</h2>
            <p>
               The first day after spring break consisted of us holding our usual sprint meeting with our customer/product 
               owner over Skype. In this meeting, we discussed what we had been working on prior to spring break, upcoming milestones, 
               as well as time constraints. We concluded the meeting by planning out what we were gonna work on this week. We then 
               met as a group/team on Friday to talk more about the milestone and split up the work (pair programming). Laura and I are 
               working on the front-end while Rob and Poe are doing the back-end. My contribution to this week's sprint was 
               developing the (home) page a scrum master interacts with after logging in.
