        <h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
        
        <h2>Week 1: 2/5/18 - 2/9/18</h2>
        <p>
            Before we even began planning or implementing our project, we visited Toyota in Georgetown in-order to meet our
            customer. During this meeting, the customer went in depth on what is expected of us this semester. After that, we met
            as a team so as to jot down ideas on how we were going to create the scrum tool. We then had our first sprint planning with the
            customer on February 6th, which resulted to us getting our first story/milestone.
            My participation this week was in the implementation of the first milestone; I created a login form, which is what
            the customer had requested for the first sprint.
