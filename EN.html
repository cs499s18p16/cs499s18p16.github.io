        <h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
        
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Week 1: 2/5/18 - 2/9/18</h2>
            <p>
                Before we even began planning or implementing our project, we visited Toyota in Georgetown in-order to meet our
                customer. During this meeting, the customer went in depth on what is expected of us this semester. After that, we met
                as a team so as to jot down ideas on how we were going to create the scrum tool. We then had our first sprint planning with the
                customer on February 6th, which resulted to us getting our first story/milestone.
                My participation this week was in the implementation of the first milestone; I created a login form, which is what
                the customer had requested for the first sprint.

            <h3>Week 2: 2/12/18 - 2/16/18</h3>
            <p>
                As per usual, we (virtually) met with our customer/product owner on Monday for a sprint planning. After this meeting, we had our work 
                cut out for us for the week, which was to allow different kinds of users (team members) to be able to login into the system
                we are implementing. Additionally, the product owner asked the team to find an alternative for hosting the web-based tool for calculating capacity. 
                The latter proved to be a much more difficult task than we anticipated therefore this week's sprint was focused on finding the best solution. My contribution this 
                week was in researching the best host for our web tool. In the end, we settled on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I also contributed in 
                updating our team's webpage; I did section 2.2
